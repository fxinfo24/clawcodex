    This is the READ side of the mode that ``persist_permission_update``

    write-only since the C1 review — its standing TODO ("setup_permissions does
    not read defaultMode back at startup; wire the read side") is this function.

    The store is the canonical permission settings layer
    (:mod:`src.permissions.settings_paths`: ``~/.clawcodex/settings.json``,
    ``<root>/.clawcodex/settings{,.local}.json``, managed policy) — NOT

    Tiers split into TRUSTED and REPO-SCOPED, which is the security boundary:

    * **trusted** — managed (root-owned MDM policy), then **user**
      (``~/.clawcodex/settings.json``). User comes before any repo file because
      that is where ``/permissions`` writes the user's own explicit choice, and
      a repo must not silently defeat it. First hit wins.
    * **repo-scoped** — ``<cwd>/.clawcodex/settings.local.json`` then
      ``settings.json``. BOTH are treated as untrusted-for-loosening. The
      ``.local`` suffix conventionally means "gitignored, operator-owned", but
      that is a property of *your* ``.gitignore``: a hostile repo simply commits
      the file. Trusting it let a cloned repo hand itself ``bypassPermissions``,
      including on ``clawcodex -p``, which returns before the folder-trust gate.

    A repo-scoped value is honored only when it is both in
    :data:`_REPO_SETTABLE_DEFAULT_MODES` and **no looser** than what would
    otherwise apply, so a repo can tighten but never loosen. ``baseline_mode`` is
    what the caller would use absent any setting — pass the interactive floor
    (``bypassPermissions``) so a repo can tighten it.

def has_allow_bypass_permissions_mode() -> bool:
    """Return True if a trusted settings source enables bypass availability.

    Follows ``hasAllowBypassPermissionsMode`` in
    ``typescript/src/utils/settings/settings.ts:897``, which reads
    ``permissions.allowBypassPermissionsMode`` and EXCLUDES the committable
    project tier so a cloned repo cannot auto-enable bypass (the TS comment: "a
    malicious project could otherwise enable bypass mode (security risk)").

    **The USER (global) tier only** — a deliberate divergence from the TS
    reference, which also reads the *local* tier. Here the local tier is
    ``<git-root>/.clawcodex/config.local.json`` (``config.get_local_config_path``
    is git-root relative, not home relative), so it is just as committable as
    the project tier the exclusion already names; ``.local`` describes a
    convention in *your* ``.gitignore``, not a trust boundary. A repo shipping
    that file could grant itself bypass availability — and availability is not a
    minor capability: ``check.py``'s ``should_bypass`` is ``mode ==
    "bypassPermissions" or (mode == "plan" and
    is_bypass_permissions_mode_available)``, and the same disjunction in
    ``tool_system/context.py`` lifts working-root containment. So a committed
    file could make ``plan`` — the mode whose whole purpose is changing nothing —
    a full write-anywhere bypass, with ``clawcodex -p`` never reaching the
    folder-trust gate. Same reasoning as
    :func:`read_settings_default_mode`'s repo-scoped tiers.

    We read the RAW per-tier config dicts rather than the merged
    ``SettingsSchema`` for two reasons: the schema has no structured slot for
    this scalar (``permissions`` is modeled as a flat rule *list*), and the
    merged view can't tell the tiers apart, which is exactly the distinction the
    security exclusion turns on.

def is_bypass_permissions_mode_disabled() -> bool:
    """Return True if a settings source DISABLES bypass availability.

    Mirrors TS ``settings.permissions?.disableBypassPermissionsMode ===
    'disable'`` (``permissionSetup.ts:939``), the negative guard on
    ``isBypassPermissionsModeAvailable`` that the port previously dropped — so
    an operator locking bypass down (managed MDM policy, or a user/local
    ``settings.json``) was SILENTLY IGNORED and bypass stayed available
    (a live fail-open; critic C12).

    Unlike the POSITIVE ``allowBypassPermissionsMode`` (which excludes the
    committable project tier so a malicious repo can't ENABLE bypass), a
    ``disable`` only ever REMOVES capability, so honoring it from ANY tier —
    including the managed/policy tier (the org-admin lockdown) and the project
    tier — is always safe. Reads the raw per-tier dicts (the SettingsSchema
    models ``permissions`` as a flat rule list, no scalar slot).

       The FILE is ``~/.clawcodex/config.json`` (under its ``"settings"`` key),

       tiers, NOT the ``settings.json`` layer that
       :func:`read_settings_default_mode` and ``setup_permissions`` read. Two
       adjacent permission knobs, two different files; an operator who sets
       ``disableBypassPermissionsMode`` in ``~/.clawcodex/settings.json`` gets
