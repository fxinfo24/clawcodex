"""Agent server — the real :data:`SpawnAgent` for :class:`DirectConnectServer`.

This is the load-bearing piece of the "TS Ink TUI as a client of the Python
backend" redesign (see ``my-docs/tui-interface-redesign/``). It drives the
canonical agent loop (:mod:`src.query.query`, via the
:func:`src.query.agent_loop_compat.run_query_as_agent_loop` adapter) for one
Direct Connect session and bridges it to the NDJSON wire protocol that the
Direct Connect client (:mod:`src.server.direct_connect_manager`, a port of
``typescript/src/server/directConnectManager.ts``) already speaks. Because the
TS client and this server agree on that protocol, the existing Ink TUI can
``claude open cc://…`` straight into this server with no TS changes.

Wire protocol
-------------
server → client (``messages_from_agent``)::

    {type:'system', subtype:'init', model, tools:[{name,description,input_schema}],
     permission_mode, protocol_version, session_id, cwd}     # once, on connect
    {type:'stream_event', event:{...text_delta...}}           # live token deltas
    {type:'assistant', uuid, session_id, message:{role,content}}
    {type:'user',      uuid, session_id, message:{role,content:[tool_result…]}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'can_use_tool', …}}
    {type:'control_response', response:{subtype, request_id, response}}  # to client pulls
    {type:'result', subtype:'success'|'error'|'cancelled', usage, num_turns, …}
    {type:'system', subtype:'recap', session_id, recap, suggestion}
                                             # post-turn recap line + tab-acceptable composer prefill

client → server (``send_to_agent``)::

    {type:'user', message:{role:'user', content:<str|blocks>}}            # a prompt
    {type:'control_response', response:{request_id, response:{behavior,…}}} # perm reply
    {type:'control_request', request:{subtype:'interrupt'}}               # cancel turn
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'set_permission_mode', mode}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'set_model', model, provider?}}
                                             # replies {ok, model, warning?} | {ok:false, error}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'get_settings'|'get_context_usage'}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'set_recap', value:'on'|'off'}}
                                             # /recap toggle; replies {ok, value} | {ok:false, error}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'worktree_status'}}
                                             # {ok, active, name?, path?, branch?, git_ok?, dirty_files?, commits?}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'worktree_exit', action:'keep'|'remove'}}
                                             # {ok, message} | {ok:false, error}; client uses a LONG timeout

Concurrency model
-----------------
The canonical permission handler is a **blocking, synchronous** callable
(``PermissionAskHandler``). To turn a permission ask into a wire round-trip we
must block *something* until the client answers — but never the asyncio loop
that pumps the WebSocket (that would deadlock: the reply can't arrive). So we
run the whole ``query()`` turn in a **worker thread**, and the permission
handler blocks that
thread on a :class:`threading.Event`. Outbound messages are handed to the main
loop with ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` (asyncio.Queue is not thread-safe).

        Returns ``content`` untouched when nothing is pending, so the common
        text-only path keeps sending a plain string (which
        ``_extract_prompt_content`` and ``add_user_message`` both prefer).

        Block order is images, then the USER'S TEXT, then the coordinate-mapping
        metadata. The metadata matters for screenshots (a downsampled image needs
        the scale factor or the model's pixel coordinates are wrong, see
        ``create_image_metadata_text``) but it must not come first, because three
        consumers flatten content by concatenating text blocks with no separator
        (``_extract_prompt_text``) and then read the FRONT of the result:

        * ``_parse_turn_budget`` -- its regexes are ``^``-anchored, so a leading
          ``[Image: source: …]`` makes a ``+500k`` directive silently no-op.
        * ``_first_prompt_preview`` -- takes the first text block, so ``/resume``
          and branch names would show the metadata instead of the prompt.
        * UserPromptSubmit hooks -- any ``^``-anchored or ``startswith`` matcher
          stops firing.

        Images stay first (the API prefers image-before-question).

        An image whose ``[Image #N]`` chip is gone from the text is DROPPED. That
        is how the chip doubles as un-attach: deleting it in the composer removes
        the image, matching the reference ("Images are only sent if their
        [Image #N] placeholder is still in the text", handlePromptSubmit.ts:225).
        The chip text itself stays in the prompt -- the reference leaves image
        refs inline and sends the bytes as separate blocks (history.ts:79).

        Minimax, which speaks the Anthropic shape), a top-level
        ``reasoning_effort`` body field on the OpenAI-compatible one — and
        sending one family's shape to the other is a hard 400. Probed

        It used to wrap OpenAI-compatible providers in an ``_EffortProvider``

        discarded in favour of the persisted setting — an inversion of the
        documented precedence (explicit beats persisted), reproducible as

        destination. Persisting is a HOST-WIDE, durable change — the value is
        read at every future launch, in every project, including headless — so
        it is restricted to sessions with ``bypass_selectable``.

        The exact predicate, since it is broader than "an interactive launcher
        owns this process": ``bypass_selectable`` is set by ``src/cli.py`` /
        ``tui_launcher`` AND is False under a ``disableBypassPermissionsMode``

        ``dontAsk`` the user has to find in a settings file to undo.

        excludes ``auto``, which ``set_permission_mode`` otherwise allows — so

        bypassing the ``set_permission_mode`` gate entirely — a client could
        answer any prompt with a setMode and take Full Access in a session where
        ``bypass_selectable`` is False. The honest TUI never does this, but the
        agent-server also serves ``--print-connect`` / ``--http`` clients, which
        is exactly the population the selectability split exists to bound.

        Two rules for a wire-supplied ``setMode``:

        * ``bypassPermissions`` needs the same capability ``set_permission_mode``
          requires;
        * a persisted destination needs :meth:`_may_persist_mode` — the same
          policy the ``set_permission_mode`` ``persist`` flag goes through.
          Writing ``permissions.defaultMode`` into the HOST's settings file makes
          one message from a remote client a permanent host-wide setting, since
          that value is read at every launch.

        Non-``setMode`` updates (rule grants) are unaffected.
